// Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

function squareNumber(num) {
	var answer = num * num;
	console.log('The result of squaring the number ' + num + ' is ' + answer);
	return answer;
}

squareNumber(3);
squareNumber(10);

// Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".

function halfNumber(num) {
	var halfNum = num / 2;
	console.log('Half of ' + num + ' is ' + halfNum);
	return halfNum;
}

halfNumber(5);
halfNumber(20);

// Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

function percentOf(num1, num2) {
	var answer = ((num1 / num2) * 100).toFixed(2);
	console.log(num1 + ' is ' + answer + '% of ' + num2);
	return answer;
}

percentOf(2,4);
percentOf(15,85);

// Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."

// Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.

function areaOfCircle(radius) {
	var area = (Math.PI * radius * radius).toFixed(2);
	console.log('The area for a circle with radius ' + radius + ' is ' + area);
	return area;
}

areaOfCircle(2);
areaOfCircle(8.5);

// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier:

function multiOperations(num) {
	// 1. Take half of the number and store the result.
	var halfNum = halfNumber(num);
	// 2. Square the result of #1 and store that result.
	var squareNum = squareNumber(halfNum);
	// 3. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
	var area = areaOfCircle(squareNum);
	// 4. Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).
	// note to TA - I *think* this means 'area / square number' but got confused by wording
	var percentage = percentOf(area, squareNum);
}

multiOperations(5);
multiOperations(1.2);
