 * anytime you need to work on a sass file, you need to sass --watch it

 * koala - you drop your folder in and it will watch/update css as you work on your sass files. once you open a project in koala it will continue to watch it, unless you remove the project from the list

 * install package control for sublime text https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st2

 * download SASS, SASS BUILD, and Emmet

 * in order to get Sublime Text 2 to build your files, you go to Tools > Build or cmd+B

 * ln -s where your sass lives if it can't find where you installed sass

###### PARTIALS

  -> koala should be watching your full project folder
  -> sass --watch should be watching your stylesheets folder
